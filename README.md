# Wave Function Collapse Terrain Generation  

This project implements **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) for procedural terrain generation**, allowing for modular and structured environments. Users can control terrain generation settings dynamically and explore the scene from a **first-person flying perspective**.

## Features  
- **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Terrain Generation** – Creates structured terrain based on adjacency rules  
- **Dynamic Grid Control** – Adjust terrain complexity by modifying the `DIM` value via a slider  
- **Randomized Yet Controlled Terrain** – Generates varied landscapes while maintaining logical connectivity  
- **First-Person Flying Camera** – Allows players to freely navigate and inspect the generated world  
- **Real-Time Scene Updates** – Press the **Reload** button to generate a completely new terrain configuration  

## Development  
- **Engine**: Unity  
- **Programming Language**: C#  
- **Algorithm**: Wave Function Collapse (WFC)  
- **Project Type**: Personal Contribution (from a two-person collaboration)  

### My Contributions  
This project was developed as part of a **two-person collaboration**, where I was responsible for implementing the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) terrain generation**, while my teammate worked on **Perlin Noise-based terrain generation**. My contributions include:  
- **Implementing the WFC Algorithm** – Created a procedural terrain generation system using **rule-based constraint propagation**  
- **Grid System with Adjustable Complexity** – Developed **DIM value control** to allow dynamic scaling of terrain complexity  
- **Camera System & Flying Mode** – Implemented a **free-flying camera system** for close-up scene exploration  
- **Interactive UI Elements** – Designed **sliders and buttons** for modifying terrain parameters in real-time  
- **Optimization & Performance Improvements** – Ensured smooth generation and rendering for large terrains
